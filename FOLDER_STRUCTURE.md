# App

- Main App setup

# Pages

- Route level components

# Features

- Components which are not related to routes, i.e. can be used in multiple routes.

# Shared

- Shared Components/logic for folders in upper layer.
- Project specific reusable code.

# Library

- reusable code that is not project specific. So, at any time that can be moved to other app/module/package.
